### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" height="25px">

👋 Hello, I'm Romain Antunes, a passionate software developer based in Switzerland. I specialize in Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, Lombok) and Angular (TypeScript, SCSS, HTML), with a focus on crafting efficient and scalable solutions.

🚀 In my recent side project, Wiiseto, I co-created a web app to streamline communication and project management for large teams. On the professional front, I've spent the last 4 years contributing to the development of internal applications at the State of Vaud, covering areas such as VM management, logs, SQL scripts, and databases. Notably, I've played a key role in developing tax-related software for population insights and judicial controllers.

💡 My journey began with small apps and game mods, evolving into the development of Discord bots with web applications, managing over 450k users. I've also contributed to the aviation community with smaller bots and developed a robust ticketing system for a game editor.

🌐 With over 8 years of self-taught experience, I've transitioned from PHP beginnings to exploring new horizons.

🌱 Currently expanding my skills into Rust.

🤝 I've made a contribution to open source by translating an app, and I'm eager to increase my involvement in the community. My tech toolkit extends to C#, .NET, Python, React, Matlab, and Pascal.
